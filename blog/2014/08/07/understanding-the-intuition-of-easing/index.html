<div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve been studying motion and I wanted to write a  post regarding what I&#8217;ve learned regarding
motion and easing.</p>

<p>A couple sources I have been reading include <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/authentic-motion.html">Google Design Guidelines regarding motion</a>
and <a href="http://rachsmith.com/">Rachel Smith&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://codepen.io/rachsmith/blog/lets-talk-about-ease-please">post about easing</a>.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation">12 Principles of Animation</a>
If you want learn more about the mechanics for easing, <a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/">Robert Penner</a>, the creator of the easing functions, provides
a good <a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/">set of resources on his site</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the keypoints to take away from both posts include</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Physical objects</strong> have mass and <strong>move only when forces are applied</strong> to them. Consequently, objects canâ€™t start or stop instantaneously. Animation with abrupt starts and stops or rapid changes in direction appears unnatural and can be an unexpected and unpleasant disruption for the user.</li>
<li><strong>Motion with swift acceleration and gentle deceleration feels natural and delightful</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Enter and exit frame at peak velocity</strong>. This behavior emulates natural movement: a person entering the frame of vision does not begin walking at the edge of the frame but well before it.
  Easing in when entering and slowing down when exiting draw the user&#8217;s attention to that motion, which, in most cases, isn&#8217;t the effect you want.
  Likewise

<ul>
<li>Use <strong>ease-out</strong> to move something <strong>onto</strong> the stage</li>
<li>Use <strong>ease-in</strong> to move something <strong>off</strong> stage</li>
<li>Use <strong>ease-in-out</strong> to move <strong>something</strong> across the stage (from one point to another)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Account for mass.</strong> Lighter/smaller objects may accelerate or decelerate faster, because they have less mass and require less force to do so. Larger/heavier objects may need more time to reach peak speed and come to rest.</li>
</ol>


<h2>What is easing</h2>

<p><strong>Easing</strong> comes into play because it used to model how <strong>position changes with time</strong>.
<a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/">Robert Penner</a> created a set of <a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/">easing functions</a> to model these positional changes.</p>

<h2>How to interpret easing graphs</h2>

<p>There is quite a selection of easing functions to choose from, so how do you choose which one works best for you?
Luckily, these easing functions have been visualized as <a href="http://easings.net/">position vs. time graphs</a>, so understanding how to interpret these
graphs is crucial for selecting the right easing. You can also <a href="http://5013.es/toys/tween.audio/">&#8220;listen&#8221;</a> to these easings.<code>Position is the y axis (vertical)</code> and <code>time is the x axis (horizontal)</code>.
For the most part, each axis is bound between 0 and 1 (representing 0 to 100% of position or time),
but as we&#8217;ll see position of easings such as <strong>easeOutBack</strong> can exceed 1 and <strong>easeInBack</strong> can go below 0.
You can also think of the bounds of the y and x axes representing start/end position and start/end time respectively.</p>

<!--
    Physics refresher
-->


<p>As a <a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/1DKin/Lesson-1/Speed-and-Velocity">physics refresher</a>,
<code>change in position = displacement = (position2 - position1)</code>and <code>average velocity = displacement / time</code>.
Looking at a position vs. time graph, we can <strong>interpret a line or curve as a set of points</strong>. Each point represents a position.
If you take the <strong>slope</strong> between the two points <code>(position2 - position1) / (time2 - time1)</code> then you get the <code>velocity</code> within that time frame.
It also important to remember that <strong>velocity is a vector quantity</strong> meaning that it represents
both a <strong>value and direction</strong> (how fast and in which direction), whereas speed is a scalar quantity only representing a value (how fast). So <code>negative velocity</code>
represents the same speed of an equivalent positive velocity but in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Finally, if you take the <strong>slope of the velocity graph</strong>, <code>(velocity2 - velocity1) / (time2 - time1)</code> then you get the <code>acceleration</code>.
In other words, <strong>acceleration tells you whether or not the object speeds up or slows down with time and in which direction</strong>.
An acceleration of 0, means that velocity was constant.</p>

<p>The follow graph from <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mechanics/motgraph.html">here</a>
as displayed below visualizes these concepts well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/motslope.gif" alt="Velocity and Acceleration" /></p>

<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mechanics/motgraph.html">Source: Hyperphysics</a></p>

<p>There are <strong> 4 basic easing functions </strong>:<br/>
1. linear<br/>
2. ease-in<br/>
3. ease-out<br/>
4. ease-in-out</p>

<p>Below we&#8217;ll look at how to interpret these graphs.
I would also recommend playing with this
<a href="http://gilmoreorless.github.io/sydjs-preso-easing/#how-it-works-demo">easing visualization</a>
created by <a href="https://github.com/gilmoreorless">Gilmore Davidson</a> which is where the
following images are adapted from.</p>

<h3>Linear</h3>

<p><img src="/images/linear-easing.png" alt="Linear Easing" /></p>

<p>The slope of this graph is a constant value, because the line is straight.
A constant velocity means that there is no acceleration.</p>

<h3>Ease-In</h3>

<p><img src="/images/ease-in.png" alt="Ease In" /></p>

<p>The slope of this graph gets steeper over time meaning that the velocity increases over time.
In other words, the object <strong>starts out slow and accelerates over time</strong>.</p>

<h3>Ease-Out</h3>

<p><img src="/images/ease-out.png" alt="Ease Out" /></p>

<p>This graph behaves in the opposite manner of an ease-in graph.
The slope of this graph gets flatter over time meaning that the velocity decreases over time.
In other words, the object <strong>starts out fast and decelerates over time</strong>.</p>

<h3>Ease-In-Out</h3>

<p><img src="/images/ease-in-out.png" alt="Ease In-Out" /></p>

<p>This graph is a combination of an ease-in and ease-out graph.
Looking at the slope, we see that initially the object starts out slow and accelerates over time before hitting a peak velocity,
followed by a gradual deceleration before stopping.</p>

<h2>Different Degrees of Easing</h2>

<p>These &#8220;standard&#8221; easing classes model position as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_function">power function</a> of <code>time t</code>
raised to some power: Linear - 1, Quad(ratic) - 2, Cubic - 3, Quart(ic) - 4, Quint(ic) - 5.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll look at these different degrees of easing by examining the <strong>easeIn</strong> curve.
Recall that bounds for time between 0 and 1 and that decimal values yield smaller values
when raised to increased powers.</p>

<p><img src="/images/degrees-of-easing.png" alt="Degrees of Easing" /></p>

<pre><code>Let t = 0.8
    t^2 = 0.64
    t^3 = 0.512
    t^4 = 0.4096
    t^5 = 0.32768
</code></pre>

<p>Since <strong>decimal values yield smaller results decrease with increased power</strong>,
this means that increasing powers exaggerates the easing effect.
In particular for <strong>easeIn</strong> easings, the object remains slower for a longer time and
accelerates faster when it finally speeds up.</p>

<h3>Linear</h3>

<p>Power of 1. Uses Constant Velocity.</p>

<h3>Quad</h3>

<p>Power of 2. Interesting tidbit to distinguish <strong>Quad</strong> from <strong>Quart</strong>: Although the prefix quad means four, quad originally referred to the four sides of a square.
Therefore a <strong>squared</strong> variable is a quadratic.</p>

<h3>Cubic</h3>

<p>Power of 3.</p>

<h3>Quart</h3>

<p>Power of 4.</p>

<h3>Quint</h3>

<p>Power of 5.</p>

<h2>Other Easings</h2>

<h3>Sinusoidal Easing</h3>

<p><img src="/images/sine-easing.png" alt="sinEasing" /></p>

<p>The position is a function of a sin: <code>p(t) = sin(t * Ï€/2)</code>.
Sinusoidal easing is quite gentle, even more so than quadratic easing.
Its path doesnâ€™t have a lot of curvature. Much of the
curve resembles a straight line angled at 45 degrees, with just a bit of a
curve to it.</p>

<h3>Exponential Easing</h3>

<p>Recall that for an exponential function such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth">exponential growth</a>,
<strong>time t is an exponent</strong> 2<sup>t,</sup> whereas in power functions time is a value raised to a constant value for example t<sup>2.</sup>
Generally exponential functions grow faster than power functions and are therefore more exaggerated.</p>

<p><img src="/images/expo-easing.png" alt="exponentialEasing" /></p>

<h4>History of Exponential Easing</h4>

<p>The Exponential Easing is based off what Robert Penner calls the <strong>standard exponential slide</strong>,
that was used often used in ActionScript, a dialect of ECMAScript used for Flash.</p>

<pre><code>// a standard exponential slide
this.onEnterFrame = function () {
var distance = this.destinationX - this._x;
    this._x += distance / 2;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is simply that you
move a fraction of the distanceâ€”say one-halfâ€”to your destination in each
unit of time. For instance, if you need to move a total of 10 feet, you could
move 5 feet, then 2.5 feet, then 1.25, then .625, and so on.</p>

<p>Notice that this is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series">Geometric Series</a>,
which is a sum of a sequence of terms where there is a constant ratio between successive terms.
The sum of a Geometric series is <code>c / (1 - r)</code>, where <strong>c is  constant multiplied to each term</strong> and <strong>r is the ratio between each term</strong>
We can verify the above example: 10 = 5 / (1 - 1/2) where <strong>c = 5 and r = 1 / 2</strong>.</p>

<h3>Circular Easing</h3>

<p><img src="/images/circ-easing.png" alt="Circ Easing" /></p>

<p>The position is a based of the equation for a half circle: <code>p(t) = 1 - sqrt(1 - t^2)</code>.
This equation is derive from the equation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle">unit circle</a> <code>x^2 + y^2 = 1</code>
Solving for <code>y</code>, we get that the upper half of the circle is <code>y = sqrt(1 - x^2)</code>.
Likewise the lower half of the circle is <code>y = -sqrt(1 - x^2)</code>, because negating the equation flips
the graph vertically (over the y axis).
Finally we add 1 to the equation so that the unit circle is shifted up to top <code>y = (-sqrt(1 - x^2)) + 1</code>,
Since the bounds of <code>time &gt; 0</code> our graph is a quarter circle residing in the top right quadrant.
This can be rewritten as <code>y(x) = 1 - sqrt(1 - x^2)</code>.</p>

<p>Similar to quintic and exponential easing, the accleration for circular easing is dramatic, but it also happens
more <strong>suddenly</strong>.
Since the circle exhibits more curvature, we see a greater range of velocity as well as sharper changes towards the
beginning of easeInCirc and at the end of easeOutCirc.</p>

<p>The following diagram displays all easings mentioned so far in juxtaposition,
ordered by roughly increasing curvature/acceleration.</p>

<p><img src="/images/standard-easings.png" alt="Standard Easings" /></p>

<h2>Special Effect Easings</h2>

<p>More complex curves have been modeled to create special effects.</p>

<h3>Back</h3>

<p>This easing exceeds the start or end position for easeIn and easeOut respectively, before springing back into place.
The easing displayed below is <strong>easeOutBack</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/easeOutBack.png" alt="easeOutBack" /></p>

<h3>Elastic</h3>

<p>This easing <strong>oscillates</strong> around the  start or end position for easeIn and easeOut respectively.</p>

<h3>Bounce</h3>

<p>The start and end position form boundaries for easeIn and easeOut respectively, whereupon the object bounces.</p>

<p><img src="/images/easeOutBounce.png" alt="easeOutBounce" /></p>

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="HspKu" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/radialglo/pen/HspKu/'>easeOutBounce</a> by Anthony Su (<a href='http://codepen.io/radialglo'>@radialglo</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>


<h2>CSS Easing</h2>

<p>Although Robert Penner&#8217;s equations were written originally as functions, many of these functions
can also be used in CSS3 using the <strong>cubic-bezier</strong> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#transition-timing-function">transition timing function</a>.
These functions have been approximated as cubic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">bezier curves</a> by <a href="http://matthewlein.com/">Matthew Lein</a>.
For more on bezier curves read this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">article</a>.
Here is a <a href="http://www.jasondavies.com/animated-bezier/">bezier curve simulation from Jason Davies</a>
and <a href="http://tholman.com/bezier-curve-simulation/">another one by Tim Holman</a>.</p>

<p>A limitation of using cubic bezier curves is that <strong>cubic bezier curves contain at most one peak and one valley</strong>.
So if you want to use an easing that has more than one peak/trough, such as <strong>easeInElastic or easeInOutBounce</strong>
then you must use a JavaScript or some other programmatic implementation of easing.</p>

<h2>How to apply easings</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, <strong>linear motion is often mechanical rather than natural</strong>.
You want to conform to the natural laws of motion so that your animation is believable.</p>

<p>However this does not mean you should completely ignore linear easings
even if your not animating mechanical objects.
Easings don&#8217;t neccesarily need be model <strong>physical position</strong>, but can really
used to model any kind of one dimensional value such as <strong>opacity</strong>.
Similarly some applications of linear easing can be used for creating
camera effects like <strong>zooming</strong> or <strong>panning</strong> when creating a <strong>timelapse</strong>
or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns_effect"><strong>Ken Burns Effect</strong></a>
for creating videos with still imagery.</p>

<p>Naturally, your eye will be able to <strong>discern something moving at a slower speed
than something moving at a higher speed</strong>. It&#8217;s no coincidence that slow motion scenes
in action movies also tend to be the most interesting.
As such, enter and exit the stage at peak velocity. Entering and exiting the stage
are less important in comparison to when the object finally halts on stage or
begins to leave the stage, respectively.</p>

<h3>Car example</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ll be animating a car to understand how to apply easing.</p>

<h4>EaseInOut</h4>

<p>Initially your car starts out <strong>parked</strong>. When you start your car,
you need to push on the pedal to <strong>accelerate</strong> to a comfortable cruising speed
and finally when you are stopping at stop light you <strong>gently decelerate</strong>
so that the ride is comfortable for your passengers.</p>

<p>If you were to witness the full start and stop action of the car you
would see an <strong>easeInOut</strong> easing.
Use <strong>easeInOut</strong> to move something <strong>across</strong> the stage (from one point to another).</p>

<h4>EaseOut</h4>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you were to see a friend arrive at your house for an evening party.
By the time your friend reaches your house he/she will already be traveling
at peak velocity and will <strong>gently decelerate</strong> before parking in front of your house.
Use <strong>easeOut</strong> to move something <strong>onto</strong> the stage</p>

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="FpLHn" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/radialglo/pen/FpLHn/'>Car driving onto stage</a> by Anthony Su (<a href='http://codepen.io/radialglo'>@radialglo</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>


<h4>EaseIn</h4>

<p>After the party, you say goodbye to your friend and watch as his/her car leaves
your neighborhood. Your friend needs to start the parked car
and accelerate to reach a comfortable crusing speed.
By the time the car leaves your field of vision it will be traveling at peak velocity.
Use <strong>easeIn</strong> to move something <strong>off</strong> stage</p>

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="tDqbr" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/radialglo/pen/tDqbr/'>Car backing off stage</a> by Anthony Su (<a href='http://codepen.io/radialglo'>@radialglo</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>


<h2>Easings in the Wild</h2>

<p>Next let&#8217;s examine how easing is being used across the web.</p>

<h3>Flickr</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> is built using <a href="https://yuilibrary.com/">YUI</a>, Yahoo User Interface Library,
Yahoo&#8217;s JavaScript framework.
The site currently uses <strong>scroll-jacking</strong>, which is
the process of overriding default user scrolling with a custom
interaction design paradigm.</p>

<p>The user interface also has arrow buttons, bullet lists, and accepts
keyboard input such as space bar / page down, j/k, arrow keys for navigation.</p>

<p>From the source code we can see the handling of keypresses and clicks.
All of these input methods are used to animate the scroll position.</p>

<h4>Keydown Source</h4>

<pre><code>Y.one(document).on('keydown', function(e) {

    var down, up, beginning, end;
    var ignoreMultiple;

    // space bar / page down, j/k, arrow keys
    if (e.keyCode) {
        down = (e.keyCode === 32 || e.keyCode === 34 || e.keyCode === 74 || e.keyCode === 40);
        up = (e.keyCode === 33 || e.keyCode === 75 || e.keyCode === 38);
        beginning = (e.keyCode === 36);
        end = (e.keyCode === 35);
    }

    // ignore if in an input, select/option etc.
    if (!document.activeElement || !document.activeElement.nodeName.match(/(input|select|option)/i)) {

        // block multiple events only for up/down arrow keys.
        if (!down &amp;&amp; !up) {
            ignoreMultiple = true;
        }

        // do the nav thing
        if (down) {
            animateTo('#section-' + getNextSection(), ignoreMultiple);
        } else if (up) {
            animateTo('#section-' + getPreviousSection(), ignoreMultiple);
        } else if (beginning) {
            animateTo('#section-1');
        } else if (end) {
            animateTo('#section-' + maxSections);
        }

        // override default actions
        if (up || down || beginning || end) {
            e.preventDefault();
            return false;
        }

    }

});
</code></pre>

<h4>Click Source</h4>

<pre><code>Y.one('body').on('click', function(e) {

        var target = e.target;
        var href = target.get('href');
        var hash, hashOffset;
        var url;
        var anim;

        if (href) {

            // a #section-x link was clicked.

            if (href.match(/section/i)) {

                hashOffset = href.indexOf('#');

                if (hashOffset !== -1) {
                    hash = href.substr(hashOffset);
                    animateTo(hash);
                    e.preventDefault();
                    return false;
                }

            } else {

                // up/down navigation links.

                if (href.match(/\#down/i)) {

                    animateTo('#section-' + getNextSection());

                    e.preventDefault();
                    return false;

                } else if (href.match(/\#up/i)) {

                    animateTo('#section-' + getPreviousSection());

                    e.preventDefault();
                    return false;

                }

            }

        }

    });

that we see being used for navigation is <strong>animateTo</strong>.</p>

<p>The primary part of that function is to note initialization of
the <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/Anim.html"><strong>YUI Animation Class</strong></a></p>

<pre><code>scrollAnimation = new Y.Anim({
    node: scrollElement,
    to: {
        scrollTop: parseInt(targetY, 10)
    },
    // if existing animation was interrupted, move really fast to indicate responsiveness.
    easing: (interrupted ? 'easeOutStrong' : (scrollAction ? 'easeBoth' : 'easeBothStrong')),
    duration: duration
});
</code></pre>

<p>The JavaScript is animating the <strong>scrollTop</strong> of the document.
Also pay attention to the line where the initialization of the easing property occurs.
Notice how there are actually three forms of easings for navigation:
 <strong>easeBoth</strong> (equivalent to easeInOutQuad), <strong>easeBothStrong</strong> (equivalent to easeInOutQuartic), and
<strong>easeOutStrong</strong> (equivalent to easeOutQuartic).
For additional eases available in <a href="https://yuilibrary.com/">YUI</a>,
refer to the <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/Easing.html">Easing Class</a>.</p>

<p>These easing are being used as follows:</p>

<h4>Flickr: Scroll Navigation</h4>

<p><strong>easeBoth</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/flickr-scroll.gif" alt="Flickr Scroll" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the user <strong>scrolls</strong>, use a easeInOutQuad easing to move to the next section &#8211; start out slow before swift acceleration
followed by gradual deceleration.</p></li>
<li><p>The easing makes sense because there is one section moving off stage (easeIn)
followed by another section moving into view (easeOut). Hence the use of easeBoth.</p></li>
<li><p>One interesting to note is that the transition is a response to the user&#8217;s scrolling.
Because the transition starts out slow, the user may percieve this as a slow responsive website.
The general rule of thumb is to <strong>respond to a user interaction quickly</strong>.
Thus, potentially slow percieved performance is tradeoff when using an <strong>easeInOutQuad</strong> transition to respond to the user.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Flickr: Click Navigation</h4>

<p><strong>easeBothStrong</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/flickr-click.gif" alt="Flickr Click" /></p>

<ul>
<li>For all other forms of input such as <strong>button click</strong> or valid <strong>keypresses</strong>
use a more dramatic easeInOut function: <strong>easeInOutStrong (easeInOutQuartic)</strong>.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s pretty interesting this easing is more exaggerated than that of scrolling.
I think the rational is that because buttons are more custom than native scrolling,
there is more flexibility to define a more dramatic transition.</li>
<li>From my view, I think the easing for scrolling and clicks should be consistent.
At the same I would imagine that users probably stay with one method of navigation
when browsing the site, so the difference could be negligible.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Flickr: Click vs Scroll Comparison</h4>

<p><img src="/images/flickr-click-scroll.gif" alt="Flickr Click Scroll" /></p>

<p>To really see the compare the <strong>click navigation(easeInOutQuartic)
vs. scroll navigation(easeInOutQuad)</strong>, notice the difference
between the click and scroll when they are performed one after another.
Since the <strong>click(Quartic)</strong> has a higher easing degree than <strong>scroll(Quad)</strong>
the acceleration for the click is more dramatic.
Note that the click occurs first followed by the scroll.</p>

<h4>Flickr: Interrupt Navigation</h4>

<p><strong>easeOutStrong</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/flickr-interrupt-click.gif" alt="Flickr Interrupt Click" /></p>

<ul>
<li>If the user tries navigating while an animation is in progress (an interrupt)  perform an easeOutQuartic
easing to the next section. (Note from the dots on the right, that we are navigating from slide 1 to 3)</li>
<li>The interaction is defined such that when an interrupt occurs navigate to the newly desired slide.</li>
<li>As such, using <strong>easeOutStrong</strong> makes sense here. Since the currently slide is already moving
it should continue moving at a high velocity before coming to rest.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Flickr: Far Click</h4>

<p><strong>easeBothStrong</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/flickr-far-click.gif" alt="Flickr Far Click" /></p>

<p>This is the same easing as the click navigation discussed above.
In this example, the user jumps over sections navigating to slide 5 from slide 1 by clicking dot 5.
The difference here is that because the scroll animation occurs over a longer distance
within the same time, the velocity here is greater.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>Some <strong>tools</strong> I would recommend to further explore easing are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://easings.net/">easings.net</a>
  <img src="/images/easings.png" alt="easings.net" />

<ul>
<li>provides a visual holistic overview of easing functions as well as methods to performing the easing in JavaScript and CSS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67">cubic-bezier.com</a>
  <img src="/images/cubic-bezier.png" alt="cubic-bezier.com" />

<ul>
<li>CSS easing tool created by <a href="http://lea.verou.me/">Lea Verou</a> to preview and compare various easings in CSS. This tool
also lets you create your own custom easings.</li>
<li>This tool also allows one to share various easings as a url by specifying the parameters as a fragment like so
<a href="http://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67">http://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/">Ceaser</a><br/>
  <img src="/images/ceaser.png" alt="Ceaser" />

<ul>
<li>Another CSS easing tool created by <a href="http://matthewlein.com/">Matthew Lein</a>.</li>
<li>Unlike cubic-bezier(mentioned above):

<ul>
<li>Has <strong>finer granularity</strong>

<ul>
<li>Rounds to <strong>thousandths place</strong> whereas <a href="http://cubic-bezier.com/">cubic-bezier.com</a> rounds to <strong>hundredths place</strong></li>
<li>For example representing <a href="http://cubic-bezier.com/#.25,.25,.39,1.37">http://cubic-bezier.com/#0.250,0.250,0.390,1.365</a>
gets approximated as <a href="http://cubic-bezier.com/#.25,.25,.39,1.37">http://cubic-bezier.com/#.25,.25,.39,1.37</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No side-by-side comparisons</li>
<li>In addition to animating position, the tools also allows you to animate width, height, and opacity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
