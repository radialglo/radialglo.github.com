  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been studying motion and I wanted to write a  post regarding what I&#8217;ve learned primarily regarding
easing.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon <a href="http://rachsmith.com/">Rachel Smith&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://codepen.io/rachsmith/blog/lets-talk-about-ease-please">beginner post on easing</a>,
a couple weeks ago which was really eye-opening.
Starting out, these tips were really helpful and spurred more research
on the mechanics and principles of easing.</p>

<p>Some additional resources I would recommend reading are</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation">12 Principles of Animation</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Animation principles written by  Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/penner_chapter7_tweening.pdf">Robert Penner&#8217;s Chapter on Tweening</a></p>

<ul>
<li>If you want learn more about the mechanics for easing, <a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/">Robert Penner</a>, the creator of the easing functions, provides
a good <a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/">set of resources on his site</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/authentic-motion.html">Google Design Guidelines regarding motion</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Google&#8217;s comprehensive guide for visual, motion, and interaction design across platforms and devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Some of the key points to take away from these posts regarding motion in general include</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Physical objects</strong> have mass and <strong>move only when forces are applied</strong> to them. Consequently, objects can’t start or stop instantaneously. Animation with abrupt starts and stops or rapid changes in direction appears unnatural and can be an unexpected and unpleasant disruption for the user.</li>
<li><strong>Motion with swift acceleration and gentle deceleration feels natural and delightful</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Enter and exit frame at peak velocity</strong>. This behavior emulates natural movement: a person entering the frame of vision does not begin walking at the edge of the frame but well before it.
  Easing in when entering and slowing down when exiting draw the user&#8217;s attention to that motion, which, in most cases, isn&#8217;t the effect you want.
  Likewise

<ul>
<li>Use <strong>ease-out</strong> to move something <strong>onto</strong> the stage</li>
<li>Use <strong>ease-in</strong> to move something <strong>off</strong> stage</li>
<li>Use <strong>ease-in-out</strong> to move <strong>something</strong> across the stage (from one point to another)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Account for mass.</strong> Lighter/smaller objects may accelerate or decelerate faster, because they have less mass and require less force to do so. Larger/heavier objects may need more time to reach peak speed and come to rest.</li>
</ol>


<p>There are already lots of posts around the web
teaching you how to implement <a href="http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/css-transitions">CSS transitions</a> and
<a href="http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/">use jQuery Easings</a> as well
as <a href="http://easings.net/">tools</a> to <a href="http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/">select</a>
and <a href="http://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67">create</a> your own easings.</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to develop an intuition of easing by:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>develop an understanding of what easings are and the relationship between
different <a href="http://easings.net/">easings</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>learn how to select/apply easings</strong></li>
<li><strong>examine real world application of easings</strong>
such as <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr&#8217;s website</a>
and <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass&#8217; website</a>.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Motion and Tweening</h2>

<p>In filmaking, movies or motion pictures can be thought of  as a series of still images or <strong>frames</strong> that
compose a complete <strong>moving picture</strong>.</p>

<p>Likewise in traditional animation, animators would either draw out every single frame
of an animation from start to end with the <strong>straight ahead technique</strong> or draw <strong>keyframes (important
frames of a sequence)</strong> and then generate <strong>intermediate frames</strong> between
the keyframes known as <strong>inbetweens</strong>. The process of generating intermediate frames
between keyframes is also known as <strong>tweening</strong> or interpolating and the resulting sequence of frames
is known as a <strong>tween</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/straight-ahead-pose.jpg" alt="Straight Ahead Pose to Pose" /></p>

<p><em>The top illustrates a straight-ahead technique, while the bottom represents
the keyframes that will be used from pose-to-pose animation</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/30/motion-and-animation-a-new-mobile-ux-design-material/">Source: Smashing Magazine</a></p>

<p>From a programmatic perspective, <strong>motion</strong> is simply <strong>the numerical
change of position with time</strong>.</p>

<h2>What is easing</h2>

<p><strong>Easing</strong> comes into play because it used to model how <strong>position changes with time</strong>.
<a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/">Robert Penner</a> created a set of <a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/">easing functions</a> to model these positional changes.
Easings are applied to <strong>tweens</strong> to specify the speed at which the animation progresses
at different points within the tween.</p>

<h3>Note on position</h3>

<p>As Robert Penner <a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/penner_chapter7_tweening.pdf">notes</a>,
<strong>position</strong> doesn&#8217;t have be a physical position but can be any one dimensional value
such as <strong>opacity</strong>. Of course you can animate two- and three-dimensional motion
such as area and volume, but these animation are broken down into several
one-dimensional values.</p>

<h2>How to interpret easing graphs</h2>

<p>There is quite a selection of easing functions to choose from, so how do you choose which one works best for you?
Luckily, these easing functions have been visualized as <a href="http://easings.net/">position vs. time graphs</a>, so understanding how to interpret these
graphs is crucial for selecting the right easing. You can also <a href="http://5013.es/toys/tween.audio/">&#8220;listen&#8221;</a> to these easings.<code>Position is the y axis (vertical)</code> and <code>time is the x axis (horizontal)</code>.
For the most part, each axis is bound between 0 and 1 (representing 0 to 100% of position or time),
but as we&#8217;ll see position of easings such as <strong>easeOutBack</strong> can exceed 1 and <strong>easeInBack</strong> can go below 0.
You can also think of the bounds of the y and x axes representing start/end position and start/end time respectively.</p>

<!--
    Physics refresher
-->


<p>As a <a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/1DKin/Lesson-1/Speed-and-Velocity">physics refresher</a>,
<code>change in position = displacement = (position2 - position1)</code>and <code>average velocity = displacement / time</code>.
Looking at a position vs. time graph, we can <strong>interpret a line or curve as a set of points</strong>. Each point represents a position.
If you take the <strong>slope</strong> between the two points <code>(position2 - position1) / (time2 - time1)</code> then you get the <code>velocity</code> within that time frame.
It also important to remember that <strong>velocity is a vector quantity</strong> meaning that it represents
both a <strong>value and direction</strong> (how fast and in which direction), whereas speed is a scalar quantity only representing a value (how fast). So <code>negative velocity</code>
represents the same speed of an equivalent positive velocity but in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Finally, if you take the <strong>slope of the velocity graph</strong>, <code>(velocity2 - velocity1) / (time2 - time1)</code> then you get the <code>acceleration</code>.
In other words, <strong>acceleration tells you whether or not the object speeds up or slows down with time and in which direction</strong>.
An acceleration of 0, means that velocity was constant.</p>

<p>The follow graph from <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mechanics/motgraph.html">here</a>
as displayed below visualizes these concepts well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/motslope.gif" alt="Velocity and Acceleration" /></p>

<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mechanics/motgraph.html">Source: Hyperphysics</a></p>

<p>There are <strong> 4 basic easing functions </strong>:<br/>
1. linear<br/>
2. ease-in<br/>
3. ease-out<br/>
4. ease-in-out</p>

<p>Below we&#8217;ll look at how to interpret these graphs.
I would also recommend playing with this
<a href="http://gilmoreorless.github.io/sydjs-preso-easing/#how-it-works-demo">easing visualization</a>
created by <a href="https://github.com/gilmoreorless">Gilmore Davidson</a> which is where the
following images are adapted from.</p>

<h3>Linear</h3>

<p><img src="/images/linear-easing.png" alt="Linear Easing" /></p>

<p><a href="http://gilmoreorless.github.io/sydjs-preso-easing/#how-it-works-demo">Source: SydJS Easing Presentation</a></p>

<p>The slope of this graph is a constant value, because the line is straight.
A constant velocity means that there is no acceleration.</p>

<h3>Ease-In</h3>

<p><img src="/images/ease-in.png" alt="Ease In" /></p>

<p><a href="http://gilmoreorless.github.io/sydjs-preso-easing/#how-it-works-demo">Source: SydJS Easing Presentation</a></p>

<p>The slope of this graph gets steeper over time meaning that the velocity increases over time.
In other words, the object <strong>starts out slow and accelerates over time</strong>.</p>

<h3>Ease-Out</h3>

<p><img src="/images/ease-out.png" alt="Ease Out" /></p>

<p><a href="http://gilmoreorless.github.io/sydjs-preso-easing/#how-it-works-demo">Source: SydJS Easing Presentation</a></p>

<p>This graph behaves in the opposite manner of an ease-in graph.
The slope of this graph gets flatter over time meaning that the velocity decreases over time.
In other words, the object <strong>starts out fast and decelerates over time</strong>.</p>

<h3>Ease-In-Out</h3>

<p><img src="/images/ease-in-out.png" alt="Ease In-Out" /></p>

<p><a href="http://gilmoreorless.github.io/sydjs-preso-easing/#how-it-works-demo">Source: SydJS Easing Presentation</a></p>

<p>This graph is a combination of an ease-in and ease-out graph.
Looking at the slope, we see that initially the object starts out slow and accelerates over time before hitting a peak velocity,
followed by a gradual deceleration before stopping.</p>

<h2>Different Degrees of Easing</h2>

<p>These &#8220;standard&#8221; easing classes model position as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_function">power function</a> of <code>time t</code>
raised to some power: Linear - 1, Quad(ratic) - 2, Cubic - 3, Quart(ic) - 4, Quint(ic) - 5.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll look at these different degrees of easing by examining the <strong>easeIn</strong> curve.
Recall that bounds for time between 0 and 1 and that decimal values yield smaller values
when raised to increased powers.</p>

<p><img src="/images/degrees-of-easing.png" alt="Degrees of Easing" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/penner_chapter7_tweening.pdf">Source: Penner</a></p>

<pre><code>Let t = 0.8
    t^2 = 0.64
    t^3 = 0.512
    t^4 = 0.4096
    t^5 = 0.32768
</code></pre>

<p>Since <strong>decimal values yield smaller results decrease with increased power</strong>,
this means that increasing powers exaggerates the easing effect.
In particular for <strong>easeIn</strong> easings, the object remains slower for a longer time and
accelerates faster when it finally speeds up.</p>

<h3>Linear</h3>

<p>Power of 1. Uses Constant Velocity.</p>

<h3>Quad</h3>

<p>Power of 2. Interesting tidbit to distinguish <strong>Quad</strong> from <strong>Quart</strong>: Although the prefix quad means four, quad originally referred to the four sides of a square.
Therefore a <strong>squared</strong> variable is a quadratic.</p>

<h3>Cubic</h3>

<p>Power of 3.</p>

<h3>Quart</h3>

<p>Power of 4.</p>

<h3>Quint</h3>

<p>Power of 5.</p>

<h2>Other Easings</h2>

<h3>Sinusoidal Easing</h3>

<p><img src="/images/sine-easing.png" alt="sinEasing" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/penner_chapter7_tweening.pdf">Source: Penner</a></p>

<p>The position is a function of a sin: <code>p(t) = sin(t * π/2)</code>.
Sinusoidal easing is quite gentle, even more so than quadratic easing.
Its path doesn’t have a lot of curvature. Much of the
curve resembles a straight line angled at 45 degrees, with just a bit of a
curve to it.</p>

<h3>Exponential Easing</h3>

<p>Recall that for an exponential function such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth">exponential growth</a>,
<strong>time t is an exponent</strong> 2<sup>t,</sup> whereas in power functions time is a value raised to a constant value for example t<sup>2.</sup>
Generally exponential functions grow faster than power functions and are therefore more exaggerated.</p>

<p><img src="/images/expo-easing.png" alt="exponentialEasing" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/penner_chapter7_tweening.pdf">Source: Penner</a></p>

<h4>History of Exponential Easing</h4>

<p>The Exponential Easing is based off what Robert Penner calls the <strong>standard exponential slide</strong>,
that was used often used in ActionScript, a dialect of ECMAScript used for Flash.</p>

<pre><code>// a standard exponential slide
this.onEnterFrame = function () {
var distance = this.destinationX - this._x;
    this._x += distance / 2;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is simply that you
move a fraction of the distance—say one-half—to your destination in each
unit of time. For instance, if you need to move a total of 10 feet, you could
move 5 feet, then 2.5 feet, then 1.25, then .625, and so on.</p>

<p>Notice that this is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series">Geometric Series</a>,
which is a sum of a sequence of terms where there is a constant ratio between successive terms.
The sum of a Geometric series is <code>c / (1 - r)</code>, where <strong>c is  constant multiplied to each term</strong> and <strong>r is the ratio between each term</strong>
We can verify the above example: 10 = 5 / (1 - 1/2) where <strong>c = 5 and r = 1 / 2</strong>.</p>

<h3>Circular Easing</h3>

<p><img src="/images/circ-easing.png" alt="Circ Easing" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/penner_chapter7_tweening.pdf">Source: Penner</a></p>

<p>The position is a based of the equation for a half circle: <code>p(t) = 1 - sqrt(1 - t^2)</code>.
This equation is derive from the equation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle">unit circle</a> <code>x^2 + y^2 = 1</code>
Solving for <code>y</code>, we get that the upper half of the circle is <code>y = sqrt(1 - x^2)</code>.
Likewise the lower half of the circle is <code>y = -sqrt(1 - x^2)</code>, because negating the equation flips
the graph vertically (over the y axis).
Finally we add 1 to the equation so that the unit circle is shifted up to top <code>y = (-sqrt(1 - x^2)) + 1</code>,
Since the bounds of <code>time &gt; 0</code> our graph is a quarter circle residing in the top right quadrant.
This can be rewritten as <code>y(x) = 1 - sqrt(1 - x^2)</code>.</p>

<p>Similar to quintic and exponential easing, the accleration for circular easing is dramatic, but it also happens
more <strong>suddenly</strong>.
Since the circle exhibits more curvature, we see a greater range of velocity as well as sharper changes towards the
beginning of easeInCirc and at the end of easeOutCirc.</p>

<p>The following diagram displays all easings mentioned so far in juxtaposition,
ordered by roughly increasing curvature/acceleration.</p>

<p><a href="http://gilmoreorless.github.io/sydjs-preso-easing/#smooth-curves">Source: SydJS Easing Presentation</a></p>

<h2>Special Effect Easings</h2>

<p>More complex curves have been modeled to create special effects.</p>

<h3>Back</h3>

<p>This easing exceeds the start or end position for easeIn and easeOut respectively, before springing back into place.
The easing displayed below is <strong>easeOutBack</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/easeOutBack.png" alt="easeOutBack" /></p>

<h3>Elastic</h3>

<p>This easing <strong>oscillates</strong> around the  start or end position for easeIn and easeOut respectively.</p>

<p><img src="/images/easeOutElastic.png" alt="easeOutElastic" /></p>

<h3>Bounce</h3>

<p>The start and end position form boundaries for easeIn and easeOut respectively, whereupon the object bounces.</p>

<p><img src="/images/easeOutBounce.png" alt="easeOutBounce" /></p>

<h2>CSS Easing</h2>

<p>Although Robert Penner&#8217;s equations were written originally as functions, many of these functions
can also be used in CSS3 using the <strong>cubic-bezier</strong> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#transition-timing-function">transition timing function</a>.
These functions have been approximated as cubic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">bezier curves</a> by <a href="http://matthewlein.com/">Matthew Lein</a>.
For more on bezier curves read this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">article</a>.
Here is a <a href="http://www.jasondavies.com/animated-bezier/">bezier curve simulation from Jason Davies</a>
and <a href="http://tholman.com/bezier-curve-simulation/">another one by Tim Holman</a>.</p>

<p>A limitation of using cubic bezier curves is that <strong>cubic bezier curves contain at most one peak and one valley</strong>.
So if you want to use an easing that has more than one peak/trough, such as <strong>easeInElastic or easeInOutBounce</strong>
then you must use a JavaScript or some other programmatic implementation of easing.</p>

-->


<h2>How to apply easings</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, <strong>linear motion is often mechanical rather than natural</strong>.
You want to conform to the natural laws of motion so that your animation is believable.</p>

<p>However this does not mean you should completely ignore linear easings
even if your not animating mechanical objects.
Easings don&#8217;t neccesarily need be model <strong>physical position</strong>, but can really
used to model any kind of one dimensional value such as <strong>opacity</strong>.
Similarly some applications of linear easing can be used for creating
camera effects like <strong>zooming</strong> or <strong>panning</strong> when creating a <strong>timelapse</strong>
or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns_effect"><strong>Ken Burns Effect</strong></a>
for creating videos with still imagery.</p>

<p>Naturally, your eye will be able to <strong>discern something moving at a slower speed
than something moving at a higher speed</strong>. It&#8217;s no coincidence that slow motion scenes
in action movies also tend to be the most interesting.
As such, enter and exit the stage at peak velocity. Entering and exiting the stage
are less important in comparison to when the object finally halts on stage or
begins to leave the stage, respectively.</p>

<h3>Timing</h3>

<p>If your just starting out some <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/look-and-feel/animations/choosing-the-right-easing">suggested duration of easings</a>
are</p>

<p><strong>Ease-outs: around 200ms - 500ms.</strong> This gives the eye chance to see the animation, but doesn’t feel obstructive.</p>

<p><strong>Ease-ins: around 200ms - 500ms.</strong> Bear in mind that it will jolt at the end (from the acceleration) and no amount of timing changes will soften that feel.</p>

<p><strong>Bounce or elastic effects: around 800ms - 1200ms.</strong> You need to allow time for the elastic or bounce effect to ‘settle’. Without this extra time the elastic bouncing part of the animation will be really aggressive and unpleasant to the eye.</p>

<h3>Car example</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ll be animating a car to understand how to apply easing.</p>

<h4>EaseInOut</h4>

<p>Initially your car starts out <strong>parked</strong>. When you start your car,
you need to push on the pedal to <strong>accelerate</strong> to a comfortable cruising speed
and finally when you are stopping at stop light you <strong>gently decelerate</strong>
so that the ride is comfortable for your passengers.</p>

<p>If you were to witness the full start and stop action of the car you
would see an <strong>easeInOut</strong> easing.
Use <strong>easeInOut</strong> to move something <strong>across</strong> the stage (from one point to another).</p>

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="Hnlod" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/radialglo/pen/Hnlod/'>Car driving across stage</a> by Anthony Su (<a href='http://codepen.io/radialglo'>@radialglo</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>


<h4>EaseOut</h4>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you were to see a friend arrive at your house for an evening party.
By the time your friend reaches your house he/she will already be traveling
at peak velocity and will <strong>gently decelerate</strong> before parking in front of your house.
Use <strong>easeOut</strong> to move something <strong>onto</strong> the stage</p>

<h4>EaseIn</h4>

<p>After the party, you say goodbye to your friend and watch as his/her car leaves
your neighborhood. Your friend needs to start the parked car
and accelerate to reach a comfortable crusing speed.
By the time the car leaves your field of vision it will be traveling at peak velocity.
Use <strong>easeIn</strong> to move something <strong>off</strong> stage</p>

<p>Now that you know how to apply easeIn, easeOut, and easeInOut
you can change the power of your easing (Quad, Cubic, Quart &#8230;)
to minimize or exaggerate the effect.</p>

<h2>Easings in the Wild</h2>

<p>Next let&#8217;s examine how easing is being used across the web.</p>

<h3>Flickr</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> is built using <a href="https://yuilibrary.com/">YUI</a>, Yahoo User Interface Library,
Yahoo&#8217;s JavaScript framework.
The site currently uses <strong>scroll-jacking</strong>, which is
the process of overriding default user scrolling with a custom
interaction design paradigm.</p>

<p>The user interface also has arrow buttons, bullet lists, and accepts
keyboard input such as space bar / page down, j/k, arrow keys for navigation.</p>

<p>From the source code we can see the handling of keypresses and clicks.
All of these input methods are used to animate the scroll position.</p>

<h4>Keydown Source</h4>

<pre><code>Y.one(document).on('keydown', function(e) {

    var down, up, beginning, end;
    var ignoreMultiple;

    // space bar / page down, j/k, arrow keys
    if (e.keyCode) {
        down = (e.keyCode === 32 || e.keyCode === 34 || e.keyCode === 74 || e.keyCode === 40);
        up = (e.keyCode === 33 || e.keyCode === 75 || e.keyCode === 38);
        beginning = (e.keyCode === 36);
        end = (e.keyCode === 35);
    }

    // ignore if in an input, select/option etc.
    if (!document.activeElement || !document.activeElement.nodeName.match(/(input|select|option)/i)) {

        // block multiple events only for up/down arrow keys.
        if (!down &amp;&amp; !up) {
            ignoreMultiple = true;
        }

        // do the nav thing
        if (down) {
            animateTo('#section-' + getNextSection(), ignoreMultiple);
        } else if (up) {
            animateTo('#section-' + getPreviousSection(), ignoreMultiple);
        } else if (beginning) {
            animateTo('#section-1');
        } else if (end) {
            animateTo('#section-' + maxSections);
        }

        // override default actions
        if (up || down || beginning || end) {
            e.preventDefault();
            return false;
        }

    }

});
</code></pre>

<h4>Click Source</h4>

<pre><code>Y.one('body').on('click', function(e) {

        var target = e.target;
        var href = target.get('href');
        var hash, hashOffset;
        var url;
        var anim;

        if (href) {

            // a #section-x link was clicked.

            if (href.match(/section/i)) {

                hashOffset = href.indexOf('#');

                if (hashOffset !== -1) {
                    hash = href.substr(hashOffset);
                    animateTo(hash);
                    e.preventDefault();
                    return false;
                }

            } else {

                // up/down navigation links.

                if (href.match(/\#down/i)) {

                    animateTo('#section-' + getNextSection());

                    e.preventDefault();
                    return false;

                } else if (href.match(/\#up/i)) {

                    animateTo('#section-' + getPreviousSection());

                    e.preventDefault();
                    return false;

                }

            }

        }

    });
</code></pre>

<p>Reading through the source you&#8217;ll notice primary function
that we see being used for navigation is <strong>animateTo</strong>.</p>

<p>The primary part of that function is to note initialization of
the <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/Anim.html"><strong>YUI Animation Class</strong></a></p>

<pre><code>scrollAnimation = new Y.Anim({
    node: scrollElement,
    to: {
        scrollTop: parseInt(targetY, 10)
    },
    // if existing animation was interrupted, move really fast to indicate responsiveness.
    easing: (interrupted ? 'easeOutStrong' : (scrollAction ? 'easeBoth' : 'easeBothStrong')),
    duration: duration
});
</code></pre>

<p>The JavaScript is animating the <strong>scrollTop</strong> of the document.
Also pay attention to the line where the initialization of the easing property occurs.
Notice how there are actually three forms of easings for navigation:
 <strong>easeBoth</strong> (equivalent to easeInOutQuad), <strong>easeBothStrong</strong> (equivalent to easeInOutQuartic), and
<strong>easeOutStrong</strong> (equivalent to easeOutQuartic).
For additional eases available in <a href="https://yuilibrary.com/">YUI</a>,
refer to the <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/Easing.html">Easing Class</a>.</p>

<p>These easing are being used as follows:</p>

<h4>Flickr: Scroll Navigation</h4>

<p><strong>easeBoth</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/flickr-scroll.gif" alt="Flickr Scroll" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the user <strong>scrolls</strong>, use a easeInOutQuad easing to move to the next section &#8211; start out slow before swift acceleration
followed by gradual deceleration.</p></li>
<li><p>The easing makes sense because there is one section moving off stage (easeIn)
followed by another section moving into view (easeOut). Hence the use of easeBoth.</p></li>
<li><p>One interesting to note is that the transition is a response to the user&#8217;s scrolling.
Because the transition starts out slow, the user may percieve this as a slow responsive website.
The general rule of thumb is to <strong>respond to a user interaction quickly</strong>.
Thus, potentially slow percieved performance is tradeoff when using an <strong>easeInOutQuad</strong> transition to respond to the user.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Flickr: Click Navigation</h4>

<p><strong>easeBothStrong</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/flickr-click.gif" alt="Flickr Click" /></p>

<ul>
<li>For all other forms of input such as <strong>button click</strong> or valid <strong>keypresses</strong>
use a more dramatic easeInOut function: <strong>easeInOutStrong (easeInOutQuartic)</strong>.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s pretty interesting this easing is more exaggerated than that of scrolling.
I think the rational is that because buttons are more custom than native scrolling,
there is more flexibility to define a more dramatic transition.</li>
<li>From my view, I think the easing for scrolling and clicks should be consistent.
At the same I would imagine that users probably stay with one method of navigation
when browsing the site, so the difference could be negligible.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Flickr: Click vs Scroll Comparison</h4>

<p><img src="/images/flickr-click-scroll.gif" alt="Flickr Click Scroll" /></p>

<p>To really see the compare the <strong>click navigation(easeInOutQuartic)
vs. scroll navigation(easeInOutQuad)</strong>, notice the difference
between the click and scroll when they are performed one after another.
Since the <strong>click(Quartic)</strong> has a higher easing degree than <strong>scroll(Quad)</strong>
the acceleration for the click is more dramatic.
Note that the click occurs first followed by the scroll.</p>

<h4>Flickr: Interrupt Navigation</h4>

<p><strong>easeOutStrong</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/flickr-interrupt-click.gif" alt="Flickr Interrupt Click" /></p>

<ul>
<li>If the user tries navigating while an animation is in progress (an interrupt)  perform an easeOutQuartic
easing to the next section. (Note from the dots on the right, that we are navigating from slide 1 to 3)</li>
<li>The interaction is defined such that when an interrupt occurs navigate to the newly desired slide.</li>
<li>As such, using <strong>easeOutStrong</strong> makes sense here. Since the currently slide is already moving
it should continue moving at a high velocity before coming to rest.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Flickr: Far Click</h4>

<p><strong>easeBothStrong</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/flickr-far-click.gif" alt="Flickr Far Click" /></p>

<p>This is the same easing as the click navigation discussed above.
In this example, the user jumps over sections navigating to slide 5 from slide 1 by clicking dot 5.
The difference here is that because the scroll animation occurs over a longer distance
within the same time, the velocity here is greater.</p>

<h3>Google Glass</h3>

<p>Next we&#8217;ll look at another implementation of a <strong>scroll-jacked</strong>
website: Google Glass&#8217; <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">start page</a>.</p>

<h4>Google Glass: Click Navigation</h4>

<p><strong>easeInOutQuart</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/glass-click.gif" alt="Glass Click" /></p>

<p>This site is implemented using CSS3.
The easing that is being used is a <code>cubic-bezier(.77,0,.175,1)</code>, which is <strong>easeInOutQuart</strong>,
and the site makes use of CSS3 transforms to translate to the next slide.
Recall that Flickr does use easeInOutQuart for some of its easing although the transition
here appears to be more pronounced because a larger object(the background image) is being moved.
This site less ways to navigate and does not allow for interrupts.</p>

<p>The gist of creating this effect is to define a state in which the slide is hidden
and a state in which a slide is active and defining how to transition between each state.</p>

<pre><code>/*
    translate 100% of the slide's body to move it offscreen
*/
.slide { 
    transform: translate3d(0,100%,0)
    transition: transform 1s;
    transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(.77,0,.175,1);
}
/*
    don't translate
    toggling the .active class on a slide will bring the slide into view
*/
.slide.active {
    transform: translate3d(0,0,0)
}
</code></pre>

<h4>Google Glass: Far Click</h4>

<p>The way this site handles skipping over sections is to fade out
the old image and fade in the new image.
It fades out the image using the default transition: <strong>ease</strong>
and then fading back in using the <strong>easeOutQuart</strong> cubic-bezier curve.</p>

<p>This interaction differs from Flickr which increases the velocity to make the jump
between slides.</p>

<p><img src="/images/glass-far-click.gif" alt="Glass Far Click" /></p>

<!--

-->


<h3>Paul Stamatiou</h3>

<p><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/">Paul Stamatiou</a> is a designer at Twitter.
This is a pretty interesting interaction he used for his site&#8217;s navigation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/stamatiou-nav.gif" alt="Stamatiou Nav" /></p>

<p>This interaction uses a custom bezier-curve <code>cubic-bezier(0.325, 0, 0.000, 1.650)</code>
which is a combination of a very short easeIn followed by an
exaggerated easeOutBack. This gives the navigation playfulness.</p>

<h3>Google Design Example: Radial Action</h3>

<p>This example is from Google&#8217;s Material Design section on
<a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/responsive-interaction.html#responsive-interaction-surface-response">Responsive Interaction</a>.
In this example we see that the epicenter of action occurs at left and ripples out to the right.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>Some <strong>tools</strong> I would recommend to further explore easing are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://easings.net/">easings.net</a>
  <img src="/images/easings.png" alt="easings.net" />

<ul>
<li>provides a visual holistic overview of easing functions as well as methods to performing the easing in JavaScript and CSS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67">cubic-bezier.com</a>
  <img src="/images/cubic-bezier.png" alt="cubic-bezier.com" />

<ul>
<li>CSS easing tool created by <a href="http://lea.verou.me/">Lea Verou</a> to preview and compare various easings in CSS. This tool
also lets you create your own custom easings.</li>
<li>This tool also allows one to share various easings as a url by specifying the parameters as a fragment like so
<a href="http://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67">http://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/">Ceaser</a><br/>
  <img src="/images/ceaser.png" alt="Ceaser" />

<ul>
<li>Another CSS easing tool created by <a href="http://matthewlein.com/">Matthew Lein</a>.</li>
<li>Unlike cubic-bezier(mentioned above):

<ul>
<li>Has <strong>finer granularity</strong>

<ul>
<li>Rounds to <strong>thousandths place</strong> whereas <a href="http://cubic-bezier.com/">cubic-bezier.com</a> rounds to <strong>hundredths place</strong></li>
<li>For example representing <a href="http://cubic-bezier.com/#.25,.25,.39,1.37">http://cubic-bezier.com/#0.250,0.250,0.390,1.365</a>
gets approximated as <a href="http://cubic-bezier.com/#.25,.25,.39,1.37">http://cubic-bezier.com/#.25,.25,.39,1.37</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No side-by-side comparisons</li>
<li>In addition to animating position, the tools also allows you to animate width, height, and opacity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>I recently relaunched my <a href="http://radialglo.com/">portfolio</a>! My site is currently runs on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>
which is a service that Amazon provides that allows users to rent virtual computers to run their own applications.
The backend of my application runs on <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a>, a web application framework for node.
My client side code is written using <a href="https://github.com/radialglo/guac">Guac</a>, a framework I wrote modeled after jQuery
after studying its source code. This framework is still under active development.</p>

<p>In this post I will talk about <strong>my NodeJS production environment on Amazon EC2.</strong></p>

<h3>How EC2 fits into Scalable Web Architecture</h3>

<p>Usually when building scalable web architecture, you will have multiple instances
of your application behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)">load balancers</a>.
Below the web server/application layer is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)">persistence layer</a> that runs
a database management system. Finally, since roughly  80-90% of the end-user response time is spent downloading static
components in the page (<a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/02/10/the-performance-golden-rule/">Performance Golden Rule.</a>),
a <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2011/11/29/how-content-delivery-networks-cdns-work/">Content Delivery Network</a> is used to distribute
static content.  A CDN manages servers in multiple geographically distributed locations,
stores copies of the videos (and other types of Web content, including documents, images, and audio) in its servers,
and attempts to direct each user request to a CDN location that will provide the best user experience.</p>

<p>Read here for more on <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/scaling">Scaling Internet Applications</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/aeb-architecture_crossaws3.gif" alt="Web Application Hosting Architecture" /></p>

<p>Amazon&#8217;s <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/wah-linux/web-app-hosting-intro.html">getting started with AWS</a>
highlights a sample web application designed in the manner described above.
From their website:</p>

<blockquote><p>In this diagram, Amazon EC2 instances run the application and web server and belong to an Amazon EC2 Security Group.<br/>The Amazon EC2 Security Group acts as an exterior firewall for the Amazon EC2 instances.<br/>An Auto Scaling group is used to maintain a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances that can handle the presented load.<br/>This Auto Scaling group spans over multiple Availability Zones to protect against potential failures if an Availabilty Zone becomes unavailable.<br/>To ensure that traffic is distributed evenly among the Amazon EC2 instances, an Elastic Load Balancer is associated with the Auto Scaling group.<br/>If the Auto Scaling group launches or terminates instances based on load, then the Elastic Load Balancer will automatically adjust accordingly.<br/>The database tier consists of Amazon RDS database instances, including master and local slave, located in multiple Availability Zones for failover protection.<br/>Amazon RDS provides automated backups to Amazon S3. Amazon S3 stores backups and static content.<br/>Since the consumers of this application may be globally distributed or a large number may visit the site at one time, high volume static content is edge cached using Amazon CloudFront for better performance.<br/>Amazon Route 53 can be used to provide secure and reliable routing to your infrastructure that uses Amazon Web Services.</p></blockquote>


<p><em><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/wah-linux/web-app-hosting-intro.html">Source</a></em></p>

<p>My personal website, <a href="http://radialglo.com">radialglo</a>, operates at a small scale and simply
use <strong>Amazon EC2</strong> to run my web and application server. Since my site recieves relatively low traffic, I currently don&#8217;t use load balancers,
and to minimize costs I currently don&#8217;t use a CDN.</p>

<h3>Create AWS account</h3>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t already create an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> account.
Please note that there is a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/faqs/">free usage tier</a> for the <strong>first 12 months</strong>
after you sign up for AWS.</p>

<h3>Setting up an Amazon EC2 instance</h3>

<p><img src="/images/EC2%20Management%20Console.png" alt="EC2 Management Console" /></p>

<p>After setting up your AWS account, you will need to choose the type of AMI you want to run.</p>

<h4>Choose an AMI</h4>

<p>An <strong>AMI</strong> (Amazon Machine Image) is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications)
required to launch your instance. You can select an AMI provided by AWS, our user community, or the AWS Marketplace; or you can select one of your own AMIs.</p>

<p>Essentially you choose the type of operating system you want to run, and create an instance of that operating system.
A similar analogy would be purchasing a <strong>MacBook Air</strong> which is an instance of the <strong>Mac OS X</strong> operating system.
At the time of the writing I selected <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/13.10/"><strong>Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) Server</strong>.</a> as my AMI.</p>

<h4>Difference Between Desktop and Server Images</h4>

<p>The server image is a stripped down version of the desktop image with additional server software such as Apache 2.
Ths additional software allows other computers/machines to communicate with your server.
The server also does not contain a GUI(graphical user interface) for security and performance reasons.</p>

<p>More from the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq#What.27s_the_difference_between_desktop_and_server.3F">ubuntu documentation</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>1. The first difference is in the CD contents. The &#8220;Server&#8221; CD avoids including what Ubuntu considers desktop packages (packages like X, Gnome or KDE), but does include server related packages (Apache2, Bind9 and so on). Using a Desktop CD with a minimal installation and installing, for example, apache2 from the network, one can obtain the exact same result that can be obtained by inserting the Server CD and installing apache2 from the CD-ROM.</p><p>2. The Ubuntu Server Edition installation process is slightly different from the Desktop Edition. Since by default Ubuntu Server doesn&#8217;t have a GUI, the process is menu driven, very similar to the Alternate CD installation process.</p><p>3. Before 12.04, Ubuntu server installs a server-optimized kernel by default. Since 12.04, there is no difference in kernel between Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server since linux-image-server is merged into linux-image-generic.</p><p>4. For Ubuntu LTS releases before 12.04, the Ubuntu Desktop Edition only receives 3 years of support. This was increased to 5 years in Ubuntu LTS 12.04 In contrast, all Ubuntu LTS Server Edition releases are supported for 5 years.</p></blockquote>


<h3>Choose an Instance Type</h3>

<p>After selecting your AMI, choose an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">instance type</a>.</p>

<p>Instance types have  varying CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity which gives you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications
Since I&#8217;m running low traffic website, I used the t1.micro instance which is part of the <strong>free eligibility tier</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/choose%20an%20instance%20type.png" alt="Choose an Instance Type" /></p>

<p>For steps 3 and 4 in the dashboard, I used the default instance and storage configurations.
I also skipped step 5 for tagging instances, because I am currently running on instance.</p>

<h3>Security Groups</h3>

<p>A security group defines firewall rules for your instances.
These rules specify which incoming network traffic should be delivered to your instance (e.g., accept web traffic on port 80). All other traffic is ignored. You can modify rules for a group at any time. The new rules are automatically enforced for all running instances. For more information about security groups, go to Using Security Groups in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).
<img src="/images/security%20groups.png" alt="Security Groups" />
<img src="/images/instance%20page.png" alt="Instance Page" /></p>

<h3>Logging into Your EC2 Instance</h3>

<p>You must use key-based authentication to login to your Amazon EC2 Instance. This allows you
to securely access your instance without a password.</p>

<p>You can also import your own key pairs to your Amazon instance. For more refer to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html">EC2 Key Pair Documentation</a></p>

<p>On a Linux/Unix instance, the public key content is placed in an entry within <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.
After you have created/downloaded your private key pair you can <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-to-connect-to-a-remote-server-in-ubuntu">ssh</a>
into your server using that private key <code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key remote_user@remote_host</code></p>

<p>I added my EC2 instance to my user <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/create-ssh-config-file-on-linux-unix/">ssh configuration</a> file in my local development environment located at <code>~/.ssh/config</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Host awshost
</span><span class='line'>    HostName 11.111.111.111
</span><span class='line'>    User bob

<p>Now I can simply ssh into my EC2 instance with the command <code>ssh awshost</code>.</p>

<p>You can also add a bash alias <code>~/.bash_aliases</code> for issuing this command. For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h3>Port Forwarding</h3>

<p>Before proceeding make sure you that the security group for your instance has been configured to accept HTTP traffic on port 80.</p>

<h4>Why port forward</h4>

<p>Running with superuser privileges (in order to bind the port) may be a security risk to the host, therefore port forwarding is used to redirect a low-numbered port to another high-numbered port, so that application software may execute as a common operating system user with reduced privileges.
Standard practices say no non-root process gets to talk to the Internet on a port less than 1024.</p>

<h4>Use case for port forwarding</h4>

<p>Express (the web application framework for node) is capable of performing everything that is expected of a modern web server, such as logging requests, HTTPS, serving files and so on.</p>

<p>If you are running a small application it may make sense to have your node application double up as a web and application server.
This is where port forwarding comes in.
Because I ran my application as both web and application server, giving root access is not ideal because my application server should not need root permissions.</p>

<p>However, if you are building a large scalable, application you should put a reverse proxy in front of the application server.
More regarding reverse proxies will be discussed below.</p>

<h4>Enable port forwarding</h4>

<p>The <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file allows you to configure various Linux networking and system settings.</p>

<p>No settings where enabled for my EC2 Instance by default. Running <code>cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</code> will print 1 if forwarding is enabled.</p>

<p>Now we want to edit <code>/etc/syctl.conf</code> to enabled port forwarding.</p>

<p><code>sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf</code></p>

<p>In this file, uncomment this line:</p>

<p><code>net.ipv4.ip_forward</code></p>

<p>This will enable ip forwarding. Then, to enable the changes made in sysctl.conf:</p>

<p><code>sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf</code> loads the values from the file we just edited.
Now, let&#8217;s check that ip forwarding is enabled:</p>

<p><code>cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</code>
This should print <code>1</code>.</p>

<h4>How to port forward</h4>

wrote a useful <a href="https://gist.github.com/kentbrew/776580">gist</a> for getting node to talk to port 80.
Here are the steps I went through.</p>

<h3>Reverse Proxy - an alternative to port forwarding</h3>

<p>A <strong>reverse proxy</strong> manages inbound request from  the internet  and manages connections within your servers, where as forward proxies
filters outbound connections from clients.</p>

<p>More specifically from the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html">Apache mod_proxy documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>An ordinary forward proxy is an intermediate server that sits between the client and the origin server. In order to get content from the origin server, the client sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server as the target and the proxy then requests the content from the origin server and returns it to the client. The client must be specially configured to use the forward proxy to access other sites.</p><p>A typical usage of a forward proxy is to provide Internet access to internal clients that are otherwise restricted by a firewall. </p><p>As standard practice in the industry, you should put reverse proxies in front of the application server to load balance and scale the app.</p><p>A reverse proxy (or gateway), by contrast, appears to the client just like an ordinary web server. No special configuration on the client is necessary. The client makes ordinary requests for content in the name-space of the reverse proxy. The reverse proxy then decides where to send those requests, and returns the content as if it was itself the origin.</p></blockquote>


<p>According to this <a href="http://blogs.citrix.com/2010/10/04/reverse-vs-forward-proxy/">article</a> written by Citrix,  reverse proxies are also particularly
good for application delivery including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Load Balancing (TCP Multiplexing)</li>
<li>SSL Offload/Acceleration (SSL Multiplexing)</li>
<li>Caching</li>
<li>Compression</li>
<li>Content Switching/Redirection</li>
<li>Application Firewall</li>
<li>Server Obfuscation</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Single Sign On</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://blogs.citrix.com/2010/10/04/reverse-vs-forward-proxy/">Source</a></p>

<p>I currently have not set up a reverse proxy, but am looking into setting one up in the next iteration.</p>

<h3>Setting Up Git for Deployment</h3>

<p>If you need a refresher on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> I would recommend talking a look at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics">Atlassian&#8217;s Git Tutorials</a>

<p>The gists of my setup is to create a create a <strong>bare</strong> repository for shared users to check in their code and a separate working <strong>directory</strong>( a single checkout of one version of the project )
that is populated with code from the bare repository via a <strong>post-recieve</strong> hook.</p>

<h4>Setting up Express</h4>

<p>First let&#8217;s install <code>express</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm i --save express</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>--save</code> saves meta data regarding your  dependencies (name and version number) into a dependency management file called <code>package.json</code>. Using the flag <code>--save-dev</code> saves the dependencies
as development  dependencies. The <em>package.json</em> file is really convenient because you don&#8217;t need to save your</p>

<p>A middleware is a JavaScript function to handle HTTP requests to an Express app. It can manipulate the request and the response objects or perform an isolated action, or terminate the request flow by sending a response to the client, or pass on the control to the next middleware
(from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Express-Application-Development-Hage-Yaapa-ebook/dp/B00DMYO1TM">Express Web Application Development</a> ).</p>

<p>I am currently using <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/express/wiki/New-features-in-4.x">Express 4</a> which is quite bare bones
in comparison to Express 3 because it no longer comes with bundled middleware.</p>

<p>My package.json for development looks like this:</p>

<p>Some useful packages include <code>compression</code> and <code>body-parser</code>.</p>

For example, Node serves static content. <code>compress</code> is used to <em>gzip</em> static content before it is
returned to the user:</p>

<h5>Templating</h5>

<p>To decouple the output representation, I used <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a>, a templating language to handle the view.</p>

<h5>AWS SDK for JavaScript</h5>

<p>Amazon also provides an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkfornodejs/">AWS Software Development Kit for NodeJS</a>.
This provides opportunities to build more complex applications.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from developing version 2 of <a href="http://radialglo.com">radiaglo.com</a>, and for next iteration
look to experimenting more with other services provided by AWS such as S3 as well as configuring servers (nginx in particular).</p>

<h3>Response</h3>

<h4>Short answer:</h4>

<p><strong>Yes</strong></p>

<h4>Long Answer:</h4>

<p><strong> Yes, but be aware&#8230; </strong>
There are <strong>different ways to add event handlers to an element</strong>,
and not all methods introduce an attribute node.
The two ways of <strong>adding event handlers by creating an attribute node</strong> are</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>directly in HTML</strong>  (what you did)</li>
<li>using JavaScript such as the method <strong>setAttribute</strong> .</li>
</ol>


<p>However there are still different ways to add event handlers that don&#8217;t introduce attribute nodes.</p>

<p>As as side note, there are 5 versions of the the DOM specification (DOM Level 0 -3)
and the current version DOM4 also known as the DOM Living Standard (http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/)
An interesting to note is that the <strong>DOM Level 2</strong> introduced the <strong>Events specification</strong> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html</a></p>

<p><em>In particular under the section 1.3.2. Interaction with HTML 4.0 event listeners,</em></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;In HTML 4.0, <b>event listeners were specified as attributes of an element. As such, registration of a second event listener of the same type would replace the first listener.</b>The <b>DOM Event Model allows registration of multiple event listeners</b> on a single EventTarget. To achieve this, event listeners are no longer stored as attribute values. </p><p>In order to achieve compatibility with HTML 4.0, implementors may view the setting of attributes which represent event handlers as the creation and registration of an EventListener on the EventTarget. The value of useCapture defaults to false. This EventListener behaves in the same manner as any other EventListeners which may be registered on the EventTarget. If the attribute representing the event listener is changed, this may be viewed as the removal of the previously registered EventListener and the registration of a new one. No technique is provided to allow HTML 4.0 event listeners access to the context information defined for each event.<br/>&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>We didn&#8217;t really talk about (in class) adding event listeners and the difference between doing it in HTML versus JavaScript,
but it&#8217;s <strong>generally bad practice</strong> to introduce event handlers in the HTML, because we want to <strong>separate the concerns</strong> of our structure(HTML) and our behavior(JavaScript).
Otherwise there is too much coupling .(This is also why CSS stylesheets are often used instead of inline CSS). There are also other reasons.
This concept is known as <strong>unobtrusive JavaScript</strong>, and you can read more about this here:<a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/The_principles_of_unobtrusive_JavaScript">http://www.w3.org/wiki/The_principles_of_unobtrusive_JavaScript</a>.
Finally let&#8217;s illustrate this through some HTML and JavaScript! Copy paste the code below into an .html file, and then open it in a browser. Click on the body and view console to see what exactly happens.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Context</h3>

<p>A fellow classmate asked the following question recently on <a href="http://piazza.com" target="_blank">Piazza</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Is the value of a attribute in a element become a node in HTML DOM?<br/>e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;good&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is &#8220;good&#8221; a text node or something else?</p></blockquote>


<p>Unfortunately, I was stumped on the question and decided it was time to finally begin reading the DOM specifications also known as <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR"><strong>DOM TR(Technical Reports)</strong></a> to get a deeper technical understanding of the DOM.</p>

<p>The current specification is <strong>DOM4</strong>. The most up to date version of this spec is available as the  <a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/"><strong>DOM Living Standard</strong></a></p>

<p>One of the things I noticed is that many developers use the term DOM in place of where <strong>DOM Structure Model</strong> or <strong>DOM tree</strong>  should actually be used.
This distinction between these two terms is  crucial in answering the question.</p>

<h3>Response</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s important to distinguish between
the <strong>DOM</strong> and the <strong>DOM tree</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The DOM is a programming API for documents.</strong></p>

<p>According to the spec,
<em>The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents.</em><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/introduction.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/introduction.html</a></p>

<p><strong>The DOM tree refers to the structure model of the document(not the DOM).</strong></p>

<p>According to the spec,
<em>In this specification, we use the term structure model to describe the tree-like representation of a document.
We also use the term &#8220;tree&#8221; when referring to the arrangement of those information items which can be reached
by using &#8220;tree-walking&#8221; methods; (this does not include attributes).</em>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/introduction.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/introduction.html</a></p>

<p><strong>In other words, attribute is considered a node in the DOM(API for documents),
but not a node in the DOM tree(structure of documents).</strong></p>

<p>More specifically from the spec,<em>
Attr objects inherit the Node interface, but since they are not actually child nodes of the element they describe, the DOM does not consider them part of the document tree. Thus, the Node attributes parentNode, previousSibling, and nextSibling have a null value for Attr objects.</em>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#ID-637646024">http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#ID-637646024</a></p>

<p>I did a search for HTML DOM, and none of the technical specifications refer to the any specification as HTML DOM, except
for W3Schools.Be cautious with the wording of W3Schools <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp</a>.
W3Schools is not affiliated with W3C and can occasionally be incorrect with some of these nuances.
There is a site created by some of the industries leading front end engineers discussing this:
<a href="http://www.w3fools.com/">http://www.w3fools.com/</a></p>

<p><strong>To answer the question is a text node created for an attribute?, the answer is yes.</strong>
From the spec,
<em>On setting(the node value), this creates a Text node with the unparsed contents of the string.
I.e. any characters that an XML processor would recognize as markup are instead
treated as literal text. See also the method setAttribute on the Element interface.</em>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#ID-637646024">http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#ID-637646024</a></p>

<p>Finally some JavaScript to illustrate this!</p>

<h3>Note on DOM4</h3>

<p>In DOM4, an Attribute object, no longer extends a node object so it is not considered a node in the DOM(API for documents) for the DOM4 Spec.
You may also notice that the nodeType ATTRIBUTE_NODE is considered deprecated.

<h3><a id="origin"></a> Origins and Uses of Ruby</h3>

<p>  Ruby was created in Japan by <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/">Yuki &#8220;matz&#8221; Matsumoto</a> and was publicly released in 1995. Ruby blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.[1] Ruby has achieved mass acceptance especially with the quick growth of Rails, the web application framework created by <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a></p>

<p>  One interesting aspect about Ruby is that <strong>everything in Ruby is an object</strong> meaning that there are instance variables with methods. Recall that in other languages such as C, primitive data types (like integers and characters) are not objects.</p>

<p>  1.<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Everything in Ruby is an object.</p></blockquote>


<h3><a id="naming"></a> Naming Conventions</h3>

<p>Local variables, method parameters, and method names should all start with a lower case letter or underscore: box, water_bottle, g6.
Instance variables should begin with an &#8220;at&#8221;@ sign, such as @id, @telephone_number
The convention is to use underscores to separate words in a multiword method or variable name water_bottle as opposed to waterBottle.</p>

<p>Class names, module names, and constants muststart with an uppercase letter. By convention they use capitalization, rather than underscores, to distinguish the start of words within the name. Class names look like Object, PurcharseOrder, and LineItem. This naming convention is also known as <strong>upper camel case</strong>, since the shape of the lettering looks like the humps of camel.</p>

<p>Rails uses <em>symbols</em> to identify things. In particular, symbols are used when naming method parameters and lookingthings up in <a href="#hash">hashes</a>
Symbols are prefixed with colons : like :action or :id</p>

<blockquote><p>By convention class names, modules names and constants use capitalization to distinguish the start of words within the name. This is known as upper camelcase<br/>because of its shape.</p></blockquote>


<h3><a id="scalars"></a> Scalars</h3>

<p>Ruby has three categories of datatypes - <strong>scalars,arrays and hashes</strong>. There are two categories of scalar types numerics and character strings. Recall that everything in Ruby is an object.</p>

<h4>Numeric Literals</h4>

<p>  All numeric data types in Ruby are descendants of the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Numeric.html">Numeric</a> class. The immediate child classes of Numeric are <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Float.html">Float</a> and <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Integer.html">Integer</a>. The Integer class has two child classes <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Fixnum.html">Fixnum</a> and <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Bignum.html">Bignum</a>.<br/>
  An integer literal that fits into the range of a machine word, which is often 32 bits, is a Fixnum object (minus 1 bit). If the integer exceeds the size of the the Fixnum object then it is coereced into a Bignum object. There is no length limitation(other than the computer&#8217;s memory size) on integer literals.</p>

<p>  Underscore characters can appear embedded in integer literals, which helps readability.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Underscores in numeric literals </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'>  <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">\</span><span class="n">_000</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="c1">#=&gt; 3000 </span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># Replace \_ with underscore. Need \ to escape underscore in markdown.</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>  A numeric literal that has either an <strong>embedded decimal point</strong> or a <strong>following exponent</strong> is a <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Float.html">Float</a> object and uses the machines double precision floating point architecture. A decimal point must be both preceded and followed by at least one digit so .35 is not valid.You must use 0.35.
   <blockquote><p>A decimal point must be both preceded and followed by at least one digit.</p></blockquote></p>

<h4>String Literals</h4>

<p>  All string literals are <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/String.html">String</a>. There are two categories of string literals, single quoted and double quoted. Single quoted literals cannot include characters(other than single quote characters) specified with escape characters. You can specify a single quote delimiter by preceding the delimiter with a <strong>%q</strong>. If the new delimiter is a parantheses, brace, bracket, or a point bracket, the corresponding closing element must be used.</p>

<p>  Double quoted strings differ from single quoted strings in two ways:
  1. They can include special characters in escape sequences
  2. The values of variables names can be interpolated into a string. With <strong>string interpolation</strong> a block of code between  #{ } is evaluated and then converted into a string.</p>

<p>  <blockquote><p>With string interpolation a block of code between  #{ } is evaluated and then converted into a string.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>  Finally a different delimiter can be used by preceding the delimiter with a <strong>%Q</strong>.</p>

<h4>Numeric Operators</h4>

<p>Most of the operatoirs in Ruby are similar to those in other common languages like + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division.</p>

<p>Note however that Ruby does not support increment(++) and decrement(&#8211;) operators.
 Note that <strong> ** </strong> is the exponentiation operator.</p>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'> <span class="c1">#=&gt; 8</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p> Operators can also serves as methods. * can be used for repetition and + can be used for string concatenation.</p>

<p>There are many <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/String.html">String</a> methods in Ruby.</p>

<p>Ruby method names can end with an exclamation mark(a bang or mutator method) or a question mark(a predicate method). A bang method changes the object in place. A predicate method indicates that a method is boolean: returns true or false.</p>

<p>  <blockquote><p>A bang method is a method name ending with a ! and changes the the object in place.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>A few String methods are summarized below.</p>

<p>  <strong>capitalize</strong> Convert first letter to uppercase and the rest to lowercase<br/>
  <strong>chop</strong> Removes the last character<br/>
  <strong>chomp</strong> removes a new line fro mthe right end, if there is one <br/>
  <strong>upcase</strong> converts all of the letters in the object to uppercase<br/>
  <strong>downcase</strong> converts all of the letters<br/>
  <strong>strip</strong> Removes the spaces on both ends<br/>
  <strong>lstrip</strong> Removes the spaces on the left end<br/>
  <strong>rstrip</strong> Removes the spaces on the right end<br/>
  <strong>reverse</strong> Reverse the characters of the string<br/>
  <strong>swapcase</strong> Converts all uppercase letters to lowercase and all lowercase letters to uppercase</p>

<p> Strings can also be accessed by an index where 0 is the first position. If a negative index is used, the index starts at the back where the last character is -1.
 Strings can also be index like [index,length].</p>

<h3><a id="io"></a> Input and Output</h3>

<p>Sometimes you may want to work with Ruby on the command line.
One way is to run <strong>irb</strong> on the command line to start the Interactive Ruby Shell and then experimenting with Ruby in the console.
You can execute a script by running  <strong>ruby</strong> <em>scriptname</em>
The <strong>-c</strong> flag can be used to check syntax. For a full set of flags run <strong>man ruby</strong>
You can also execute a script by  putting <strong>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</strong> at the top of your script and running your script like so <strong>./scriptname</strong>
If you use this method make sure that your script is executable by running <strong>chmod +x</strong>. Generally ruby scripts end with the extension <strong>.rb</strong></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p><strong>print</strong> is used to output a string.
<strong>puts</strong> behaves like print but adds a newline to the end of output.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p><strong>gets</strong> is used to retrieve a line of input from the keyboard.
The parsed input is a string, and you can use string methods to filter the string.
Use methods such as <strong>to_i</strong> or <strong>to_f</strong> to convert the input into an integer or float respectively.</p>

<h3><a id="control_statements"></a> Control Statements</h3>

<p>Control Statements are used to control execution flow of a program.</p>

<h4>Control Expressions</h4>

<p>Control Expressions are logical expressions used to for control statments. A relational operator has two operands and an operator
Relational Operator</p>

<p><strong>==</strong> equals<br/>
<strong>!=</strong> not equals<br/>
<strong>&lt;</strong> less than<br/>
<strong>></strong> greater than<br/>
<strong>&lt;=</strong> less than or equal to<br/>
<strong>>=</strong> greater than or equal to<br/>
<strong>&lt;=></strong> Comparator: for a &lt;=> b returns 1 if a > b , -1 if a &lt; b, and  0 if a == b This operator is also very help for sorting.<br/>
<strong>eql?</strong> returns true if parameter and reciever object have same type and value. <br/>
<strong>equal?</strong> returns true if parameter is the same as the reciever object. Effectly checks for same references.</p>

<h5>Operator Precedence and associativity</h5>

<p><strong>Operator precendence</strong> specifies the order in which operations should be carried out.
The following operators are listed in precedence from greatest to least (in descending order).
Operators on the same line have the same precedence. <strong>Associativity</strong> tells you how to evaluate operations
if two or more operators have the same precendence either start evaluating from the left or right. If operators
are nonassociative that means that these operators cannot associative with themselves.</p>

<p><strong>collect</strong> is an iterator that applies the block on each element of the array.
It creates a new array containing the values returned by the block.

<blockquote><p>Methods can transfer control to a block and back again. This is known as the yield method, which invokes the block with an optional parameter.</p></blockquote>


<h3><a id ="procs_and_lambdas"></a> Procs and Lambdas</h3>

<h4>TODO</h4>

<h4>Proc</h4>

<p><strong>Procs</strong> are full-fledged objects, so they have all the powers and abilities of objects. (Blocks do not.)</p>

<p>Unlike blocks, <strong>procs can be called over and over without rewriting them</strong>. This prevents you from having to retype the contents of your block every time you need to execute a particular bit of code.</p>

<p>http://www.robertsosinski.com/2008/12/21/understanding-ruby-blocks-procs-and-lambdas/
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1435743/why-does-explicit-return-make-a-difference-in-a-proc
http://ablogaboutcode.com/2012/01/04/the-ampersand-operator-in-ruby/</p>

<h4>lambda</h4>

<p>First, a lambda checks the number of arguments passed to it, while a proc does not. This means that a lambda will throw an error if you pass it the wrong number of arguments, whereas a proc will ignore unexpected arguments and assign nil to any that are missing.</p>

<p>Second, when a lambda returns, it passes control back to the calling method; when a proc returns, it does so immediately, without going back to the calling method.</p>

<h3><a id="arrays"></a> Fundamentals of Arrays</h3>

<p>An <strong>array</strong> is a series of elements. If you have arrays of arrays this is known as a <strong>multi-dimensional array</strong>. Array elements are indexed by integers with the first element being 0.</p>

<p>Ruby arrays differs from more traditional langauges such as C,C++, and Java because the lenght of an array is dynamic. They can shrinkand grown during program execution. If you&#8217;ve worked with C++, this is the same behaviior as a vector.</p>

<p>Generally arrays must store homogenous elements (elements of the same type). However Ruby arrays store heterogenous elements or a mix of elements.</p>

<h3><a id="hash"></a> Hashes</h3>

<p>Arrays are indexed by integers.
There is another key, value collection called a <strong>hash</strong> where an object is reference by another object known as a <strong>symbol</strong>.
If you&#8217;re coming from a background in JavaScript, PHP, you maybe used to acessing hashes using strings.</p>

<p>Here is a good description of why symbols are used as hash keys in Ruby</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Using symbols not only saves time when doing comparisons, but also saves memory, because they are only stored once.</p><p>Symbols in Ruby are basically &#8220;immutable strings&#8221; . That means that they can not be changed, and it implies that the same symbol when referenced many times throughout your source code, is always stored as the same entity, e.g. has the same object id.</p><p>Strings on the other hand are mutable, they can be changed anytime. This implies that Ruby needs to store each string you mention throughout your source code in it&#8217;s separate entity, e.g. if you have a string &#8220;name&#8221; multiple times mentioned in your source code, Ruby needs to store these all in separate String objects, because they might change later on (that&#8217;s the nature of a Ruby string).</p><p>If you use a string as a Hash key, Ruby needs to evaluate the string and look at it&#8217;s contents (and compute a hash function on that) and compare the result against the (hashed) values of the keys which are already stored in the Hash.</p><p>If you use a symbol as a Hash key, it&#8217;s implicit that it&#8217;s immutable, so Ruby can basically just do a comparison of the (hash function of the) object-id against the (hashed) object-ids of keys which are already stored in the Hash. (much faster)</p><p>Notes:</p><p>If you do string comparisons, Ruby can compare symbols just by their object ids, without having to evaluate them. That&#8217;s much faster than comparing strings, which need to be evaluated.</p><p>If you access a hash, Ruby always applies a hash-function to compute a &#8220;hash-key&#8221; from whatever key you use. You can imagine something like an MD5-hash. And then Ruby compares those &#8220;hashed keys&#8221; against each other.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Each object is identified by an integer which can be retrieved using the method <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Object.html#method-i-object_id">.object_id</a>.
As mentioned previously <strong>only one copy of a symbol exists at a given time</strong>, meaning that there exists only one object id for that symbol.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ay mate! I recently decided to start blogging about code with <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> as my blogging engine. This blog will focus on documenting my coding ventures. I&#8217;ve encountered other file based cms(content management systems) such as  <a href="http://getkirby.com">kirby</a> and <a href="http://www.staceyapp.com">stacey</a> (which run on PHP as opposed to Ruby), but ultimately decided to work with octopress because this framework is designed for Jekyll, the blog aware static site generator that powers <a href="pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> (so this site can be hosted on github). As an added bonus working with octopress provides beginners a good opportunity to tinker around in a Ruby environment.</p>

<p>Installing octopress on my local machine Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) was met with some setbacks which I resolved as describe below:</p>

<p>At the time of installing octopress,a prerequistie for installation was Ruby 1.9.3. I used <a href="http://rvm.io">rvm</a>(Ruby Version Manager) as a utility to download the ruby binary. Unfortunately my installiation failed when running rvm install 1.9.3, so I re-ran the installation command in <em>debug mode</em> to print out additional output to locate the source of this issue.</p>

<p>It turned out the public release 392(p392) binary file for 32-bit Ubuntu 11.10 could not be located from the various urls referenced by rvm and I couldn&#8217;t locate the binaries via a Google search either.</p>

<p>After browsing around I also tried a solution that uses ruby-rvm, but also discovered that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9056008/installed-ruby-1-9-3-with-rvm-but-command-line-doesnt-show-ruby-v/9056395#9056395">Ubuntu warps ruby-rvm</a>.</p>

<p>I ended install the head of ruby-1.9.3 and also ruby-2.0.0. So far I have been running octopress on ruby-2.0.0 and have not encountered any issues.</p>

<p>After downloading the 1.9.3-head and 2.0.0 binaries, I had issues running bundle install (which installs dependencies specified in my Gemfile). The error reported the bundler itself not being installed even though I installed it in the previous command.
It turned out that my bundler was installed to a specific gemset and once I installed the bundler to the global gemset, bundle install could be executed.</p>
